# Fight For Fame

Fight For Fame is a multiplayer game where different players are spawned into an arena and fight against enemy NPC's and each other.

Every wave the NPC's get harder to kill and the final wave you have to kill a boss that is scaled on the amount of players that started the game.  

The objective of the game is to kill the boss and all other players to win. The challenge is to find the right balance between teamwork with other players and your own victory!
